\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis aims to compare a few different ways in which a camera onboard a drone can be controlled in real-time and evaluate the operator’s experience with the different controls at different latencies. The different controls are to be evaluated through a Quality of Experience (QoE) user experiment, where subjective measurements will be collected from experienced and inexperienced drone operators performing a task with the different controls.

This thesis work is a collaboration between the Swedish Sea Rescue Society and the Department of Electrical and Information Technology at (+the Faculty of Engineering?) Lund University. 

\chapter{Background}
With the promise of real-time remote control over 5G, the systems of tomorrow will be heavily reliant on the uptime and latency of the network, making these systems exposed to vulnerabilities should the network experience high contingency or failure. Therefore, Having a system that can operate in a degraded state, i.e. with high latency, is a necessity. Furthermore, when 5G is more widely adopted and stable, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) might offer plans with different latencies, giving the user a choice of how much they want to pay for latency that their particular application needs.  

In the emerging field of research around drones and remote control, there is a clear correlation between latency and the operator’s experience. However, a comparison of different types of controls and their effect on the operator at different latencies are, as far as the student’s knowledge goes, not documented in the current body of research. The technical challenges that SSRS faces align very well with the challenges that are posed in general so-called “Industry 4.0”, and the highly dynamic environment in which the drone will operate along with the area of operation being far from any land-based infrastructure make a good case to employ learning outcomes from previous QoE research. 

Furthermore, SSRS does not have an estimate of the latency of the video feed from the drone, making it difficult to determine how the camera should be controlled, be it by swiping, pressing the arrow keys or setting a location on a map for it to look at. In the emerging field of research around drones and remote control, there is a clear correlation between latency and the operator’s experience. However, a comparison of different types of controls and their effect on the operator at different latencies are, as far as the student’s knowledge goes, not documented in the current body of research.

This is a reference to ~\cite{Industry4}.

\section{Swedish Sea Rescue Society}
As can be read on their website \cite{ssrs}, the Swedish Sea Rescue Society (SSRS) is a non-profit organization that was founded at a conference in Stockholm in 1906 due to Sweden receiving criticism of its' poor sea rescue. Today, it is a foundation with 40 employees and over 143 000 members, and with 2400 volunteers manning their 260 rescue vessels, they carry out around 90\% of all sea rescues in Sweden all year around.

\subsection{Innovation}
 As stated in their statutes \cite{ssrs-statues}, the mission of SSRS is not solely to carry out these rescue missions but to also innovate and collaborate in the area of maritime rescue as well as other aiding activities in society as a whole. As a result of this, the drone project that this thesis is a part of has been conceived along with other innovation projects such as foiling rescue boats and improved rescue vehicles \cite{surtsey-innovation}.

\subsection{Eyes On Sight}
Currently, SSRS has a drone connected to the mobile network that can fly towards and loiter around a set of waypoints given on a map, while also providing video from the gimbal-mounted camera. The drone flies with a hardware module running the autopilot software ArduPilot which also supports camera gimbal control. The mechanical gimbal assembly supports three degrees of freedom, however, the software necessary for remotely controlling the camera gimbal is not implemented.

\section{Quality of Experience}
Quality of Experience is an emerging research field that is concerned with the user's experience in multimedia systems. It is an inherently multidisciplinary field that has close ties to the field of User Experience (UX) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). QoE is also closely related to the field of Quality of Service (QoS), which is concerned with the technical aspects of a system but aims instead at evaluating the subjective experience through user experiments rather than qualitative measurements.

In the white paper \cite{qoe-definition}, Brunström et al. make a working definition of Quality of Experience: 

\begin{quote}
   \textit{Quality of Experience (QoE) is the degree of delight or annoyance of the user of an application or service. It results from the fulfillment of his or her expectations with respect to the utility and / or enjoyment of the application or service in the light of the user’s personality and current state.} 
\end{quote}


\section{Previous Work}

W. Tärneberg et al. \cite{industry4.0} present a QoE study with industrial equipment on an excavation site where experienced operators controlled their usual equipment remotely at different latencies. 

K. Brunnström et al. \cite{latency-impact} performed a study on log lifting using a head-mounted display system. In the study, latency is introduced both in the display's response to movement as well as the controls. The display delay was found to have a strong effect on nausea, but an observable effect on controller latency could only be found at latencies above 800 ms. 

\section{System Overview}
Due to the amount of software components executing on different machines in this control system, this section aims to provide an initial overview for the reader to understand its architecture.

First, the system will be divided into components, then each of the components will be described in more detail. A visual overview of the system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:system-overview}.
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{system-overview.png} 
   \caption{An overview of the entire system. On the left, the drone and its' components including the RPi, RPi camera module and the flight controller are shown. On the right, the ground station and its' components including the web application, Janus server and the controller are shown. The colour of the connections represent what data they transfer, where orange is video, orange double-line is video negotiation and yellow is control.}
   \label{fig:system-overview}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Components}
The complete system can be divided in two, where on component is the video feed and the other is the control of the gimbal, although some components are used in both.

The video feed involves the following components:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Raspberry Pi Camera Module: records video
   \item Raspberry Pi 4: sends the video feed to the Janus server
   \item Janus Server: establishes a WebRTC connection to the web browser
   \item Web Browser: displays the video feed
\end{itemize}

The control of the gimbal involves the following components:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Raspberry Pi 4: relays messages between the flight controller and the ground station, often referred to as companion computer.
   \item Flight Controller: controls all flight and gimbal functions
   \item Web Browser: user inputs from joystick
   \item pymavlink: Python library to send commands to flight controller
   \item MAVProxy: software running on a companion computer to relay messages between the flight controller and the ground station
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware}
This chapter will briefly go through the main components of hardware that have been used in this thesis.

\subsection{Flight controller}
The flight controller is the brain of the aircraft and houses the following components:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Central Processing Unit (CPU)
   \item Ardupilot firmware (described in \ref*{sec:ardupilot})
   \item accelerometer
   \item connector to external GPS receiver
   \item servo-connectors for aircraft control surfaces and gimbal
\end{itemize}
   
\subsection{Raspberry Pi 4}
The Raspberry serves as the onboard computer, commonly known as the "companion computer" in the context of drone hardware. It is connected to the flight controller via USB and relays messages between the flight controller and the ground station (through mavlink-router \ref{sec:mavlink-router}) over its connection to the Internet. In the SSRS drone, the Raspberry has a 4G modem which is what allows the drone to fly beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).

\subsection{Gimbal}
The gimbal used in the experiment is designed and manufactured by Fredrik Falkman at the SSRS. It is a 3D-printed design that has three degrees of freedom made possible by three servos connected to drive belts that control each axis of the camera. The servos are connected to the flight controller which also provides them with power. The gimbal also hosts a Raspberry Pi Camera Module which is directly connected to the Raspberry with a ribbon cable.  

\section{Software}
This chapter will briefly go through the main components of the software that have been used in this thesis.

\subsection{Firmware: ArduPlane}
\label{sec:ardupilot}
The firmware running on the flight controller is called ArduPlane, which is part of the open-source autopilot software suite ArduPilot that enables the creation of unmanned, autonomous vehicles \cite{ardupilot-org}. It is developed by a community of developers and is available on GitHub \cite{ardupilot-github}.

\subsection{Protocol: MAVLink}
As can be read on their website \cite{mavlink}, MAVLink is a lightweight protocol suited for communication with drones and between drone components. It has a byte overhead of only 14 bytes and allows for concurrent communication between up to 255 systems. 

\subsection{Software: mavlink-router}
\label{sec:mavlink-router}
The software mavlink-router is a daemon that allows for the routing of MAVLink messages between multiple endpoints \cite{mavlink-router}. In this thesis, it is run on the companion computer to relay MAVLink messages between the flight controller and the ground station.

\subsection{Software: MAVProxy}
MAVProxy is a software running on the companion computer whose main task is to relay MAVLink messages between the flight controller and the ground station \cite{mavproxy}. This is required as a mobile network modem cannot be connected directly to the flight controller. 

\subsection{Package: pymavlink}
This package is the Python interface to the MAVLink protocol, available at \cite{pymavlink}. In this thesis, it is used to send and receive MAVLink messages on the GCS.

\subsection{UV4L}
UV4L is a video streaming server that supports real-time communication protocols such as WebRTC \cite{uv4l}. In this thesis, it is the software used to stream the local video feed over the web. 

\subsection{Janus Server}
As described on their webpage \cite{janus}, Janus is a plugin-based software that helps establish WebRTC connections. In this thesis it is used to establish the connection between the UV4L server and the web browser, enabling the peer-to-peer connection between the two devices.

\chapter{Method}
This chapter will describe the method used in the experiment.

\section{Experimental Setup}
The experimental setup consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
   \item GCS: 
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Computer running the video feed
      \item Controller with joystick 
   \end{itemize}
   
   \item Gimbal and object
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Gimbal mounted on the drone
      \item An object to follow
      \item Something making the object or gimbal move
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
   \item User gets 30 seconds to familiarize themselves with the controls
   \item User is given instructions on the task
   \item User performs task (follow an object, ball)
\end{itemize}

\section{Evalutation}
The following two sections will describe the quantative and qualitative methods that are used to evaluate the performance of the system. 

\subsection{Quantative Evaluation}
To quantify the performance of the test subject a printed apriltag will be attached on top of the robot that the subject will try to follow. The view from the camera will be recorded during the experiment and then an image recognition software will be used to detect the position of the robot. 

This will make it possible to calculate the distance of the recognized object to the center of the video feed which then can be used to measure the performance of the test subject.

An Apriltag is a QR-code that contains bigger squares, thus making it easier to recognize for a computer vision algorithm

\subsection{Qualitative Evaluation}
After each trial set the subject will answer questions regarding their perceived quality of experience with the system. They will also get to answer a sickness questionnaire, following standard questionnaire provided by \cite{SICKNESSQ}.

\hline 
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

\subsection{Headers and Footers}
Note that the page headers are aligned towards the outside of the page (right on the right-hand page, left on the left-hand page) and they contain the section title on the right and the chapter title on the left respectively, in \textsc{SmallCaps}. The footers contain only page numbers on the exterior of the page, aligned right or left depending on the page. The lines used to delimit the headers and footers from the rest of the page are $0.4 pt$ thick, and are as long as the text.

\subsection{Chapters, Sections, Paragraphs}
Chapter, section, subsection, etc. names are all left aligned, and numbered as in this document. 

Chapters always start on the right-hand page, with the label and title separated from the rest of the text by a $0.4 pt$ thick line.

Paragraphs are justified (left and right), using single line spacing. Note that the first paragraph of a chapter, section, etc. is not indented, while the following are indented.

\subsection{Tables}
Table captions should be located above the table, justified, and spaced 2.0cm from left and right (important for very long captions). Tables should be numbered, but the numbering is up to you, and could be, for instance:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Table X.Y} where X is the chapter number and Y is the table number within that chapter. (This is the default in \LaTeX. More on {\LaTeX} can be found on-line, including whole books, such as \cite{goossens93}.) or
\item \textbf{Table Y} where Y is the table number within the whole report
\end{itemize}
As a recommendation, use regular paragraph text in the tables, bold headings and avoid vertical lines (see Table \ref{tab:fonts}). 

\subsection{Figures}
Figure labels, numbering, and captions should be formed similarly to tables. As a recommendation, use vector graphics in figures (Figure \ref{fig:vectorg}), rather than bitmaps (Figure \ref{fig:rasterg}). Text within figures usually looks better with sans-serif fonts.
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=2.5]{examplepic1.pdf} 
\caption{A PDF vector graphics figure. Notice the numbering and placement of the caption. The caption text is indented 2.0cm from both left and right text margin.}\label{fig:vectorg}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=2.5]{examplepic3.jpg} 
\caption{A JPEG bitmap figure. Notice the bad quality of such an image when scaling it. Sometimes bitmap images are unavoidable, such as for screen dumps.}\label{fig:rasterg}
\end{figure}
For those interested in delving deeper into the design of graphical information display, please refer to books such as \cite{Tufte:1986, few2012show}.

\section{Mathematical Formulae and Equations}
You are free to use in-text equations and formulae, usually in \textit{italic serif} font. For instance: $S = \sum_i a_i$. We recommend using numbered equations when you do need to refer to the specific equations:
\begin{equation}
E = \int_0^{\delta} P(t) dt \quad \longleftrightarrow \quad E = m c^2
\end{equation}
The numbering system for equations should be similar to that used for tables and figures.

\section{References}
Your references should be gathered in a \textbf{References} section, located at the end of the document (before \textbf{Appendices}). We recommend using number style references, ordered as appearing in the document or alphabetically. Have a look at the references in this template in order to figure out the style, fonts and fields. Web references are acceptable (with restraint) as long as you specify the date you accessed the given link \cite{fontspec, CTAN}. You may of course use URLs directly in the document, using mono-space font, i.e. \url{http://cs.lth.se/}.

Make sure you add references as close to the claim as possible~\cite{CTAN}, as shown, not at the end of a whole paragraph. Notice also that there is a space before the reference; best is to use \verb+~\cite{ref}+, to allow for unbreakable spaces. References should not be used after the period marking the end of sentence. Using the reference as follows (end of paragrah, after period) is {\em{strongly discouraged}}, since it says nothing about which specific claim you provide the reference for. \cite{fontspec} 

 

\section{Colours}
As a general rule, all theses are printed in black-and-white, with the exception of selected parts in selected theses that need to display colour images essential to describing the thesis outcome (\textit{computer graphics}, for instance).

A strong requirement is for using \textbf{black text on white background} in your document's main text. Otherwise we do encourage using colours in your figures, or other elements (i.e. the colour marking internal and external references) that would make the document more readable on screen. You may also emphasize table rows, columns, cells, or headers using white text on black background, or black text on light grey background.

Note that the document should look good in black-and-white print. Colours are often rendered using monochrome textures in print, which makes them look different from on screen versions. This means that you should choose your colours wisely, and even opt for black-and-white textures when the distinction between colours is hard to make in print. The best way to check how your document looks, is to print out a copy yourself.

The {\LaTeX}  class defines also a few {\em LTH} standard colours, which you could use in your document for various elements, to adhere to the standard university profile. \\These are: {\color{LTHblue}LTHblue}, {\color{LTHbronze}LTHbronze}, {\color{LTHgreen}LTHgreen}, {\color{LTHpink}LTHpink}, {\color{LTHcyan}LTHcyan}, {\color{LTHgrey}LTHgrey}.

\chapter{Language}

You are strongly encouraged to write your report in English, for two reasons. First, it will improve your use of English language. Second, it will increase visibility for you, the author, as well as for the Department of Computer Science, and for your host company (if any).

However, note that your examiner (and supervisors) are not there to provide you with extensive language feedback. We recommend that you check the language used in your report in several ways:
\begin{description}
\item[Reference books] dedicated to language issues can be very useful. \cite{heffernan2000writing} 
\item[Spelling and grammar checkers] which are usually available in the commonly used text editing environments.
\item[Colleagues and friends] willing to provide feedback your writing.
\item[Studieverkstaden] is a university level workshop, that can help you with language related problems (see \href{http://www.lu.se/studera/livet-som-student/service-och-stod/studieverkstaden}{Studieverkstaden}'s web page).
\item[Websites] useful for detecting language errors or strange expressions, such as
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{http://translate.google.com}
\item \url{http://www.gingersoftware.com/grammarcheck/}
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\section{Style Elements}
Next, we will just give some rough guidelines for good style in a report written in English. Your supervisor and examiner as well as the aforementioned \textbf{Studieverkstad} might have a different  take on these, so we recommend you follow their advice whenever in doubt. If you want a reference to a short style guide, have a look at \cite{shortstyleguide}.

\subsubsection{Widows and Orphans}

Avoid \textit{widows} and \textit{orphans}, namely words or short lines at the beginning or end of a paragraph, which are left dangling at the top or bottom of a column, separated from the rest of the paragraph.

\subsubsection{Footnotes}

We strongly recommend you avoid footnotes. To quote from \cite{OGSW}, \textit{Footnotes are frequently misused by containing information which should either be placed in the text or excluded altogether. They should be avoided as a general rule and are acceptable only in exceptional cases when incorporation of their content in the text  [is] not possible.} 

\subsubsection{Active vs. Passive Voice}

Generally active voice (\textit{I ate this apple.}) is easier to understand than passive voice (\textit{This apple has been eaten (by me).}) In passive voice sentences the actor carrying out the action is often forgotten, which makes the reader wonder who actually performed the action. In a report is important to be clear about who carried out the work. Therefore we recommend to use active voice, and preferably the plural form \textit{we} instead of \textit{I} (even in single author reports).

\subsubsection{Long and Short Sentences}
A nice brief list of sentence problems and solutions is given in \cite{yalesentences}. Using choppy sentences (too short) is a common problem of many students. The opposite, using too long sentences, occurs less often, in our experience.

\subsubsection{Subject-Predicate Agreement}
A common problem of native Swedish speakers is getting the subject-predicate (verb) agreement right in sentences. Note that a verb must agree in person and number with its subject. As a rough tip, if you have subject ending in \textit{s} (plural), the predicate should not, and the other way around. Hence, \textit{only one s}. Examples follow:
\begin{description}
\item[incorrect] He have to take this road.
\item[correct] He has to take this road.
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[incorrect] These words forms a sentence.
\item[correct] These words form a sentence.
\end{description}
\noindent In more complex sentences, getting the agreement right is trickier. A brief guide is given in  the \textit{20 Rules of Subject Verb Agreement} \cite{subjectverb}.

\chapter{Structure}
It is a good idea to discuss the structure of the report with your supervisor rather early in your writing. Given next is a generic structure that is a starting point, but by no means the absolute standard. Your supervisor should provide a better structure for the specific field you are writing your thesis in. Note also that the naming of the chapters is not compulsory, but may be a helpful guideline.
\begin{description}
\item[Introduction] should give the background of your work. Important parts to cover:
\begin{itemize}
\item Give the context of your work, have a short introduction to the area.
\item Define the problem you are solving (or trying to solve).
\item Specify your contributions. What does this particular work/report bring to the research are or to the body of knowledge? How is the work divided between the co-authors? (This part is essential to pinpoint individual work. For theses with two authors, it is compulsory to identify which author has contributed with which part, both with respect to the work and the report.)
\item Describe related work (literature study). Besides listing other work in the area, mention how is it related or relevant to your work. The tradition in some research area is to place this part at the end of the report (check with your supervisor).
\end{itemize}
\item[Approach] should contain a description of your solution(s), with all the theoretical background needed. On occasion this is replaced by a subset or all of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Method}: describe how you go about solving the problem you defined. Also how do you show/prove that your solution actually works, and how well does it work.
\item \textbf{Theory}: should contain the theoretical background needed to understand your work, if necessary.
\item \textbf{Implementation}: if your work involved building an artefact/implementation, give the details here. Note, that this should not, as a rule, be a chronological description of your efforts, but a view of the result. There is a place for insights and lamentation later on in the report, in the Discussion section.
\end{itemize}
\item[Evaluation] is the part where you present the finds. Depending on the area this part contains a subset or all of the following: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Experimental Setup} should describe the details of the method used to evaluate your solution(s)/approach. Sometimes this is already addressed in the \textbf{Method}, sometimes this part replaces \textbf{Method}.
\item \textbf{Results} contains the data (as tables, graphs) obtained via experiments  (benchmarking, polls, interviews). Here you should also describe the individual tables or graphs in text, pointing out interesting outliers and trends.
\item \textbf{Discussion} allows for a longer discussion and interpretation of the results from the evaluation, including extrapolations and/or expected impact. Focus here on a broader view of the results, talking about the relation between the different finds.\footnote{Bad practice is to display graphs in Results and then describe them textually one by one in here. No! Both sections should have some discussion, but one targets individual finds and the other tries to bridge between these adopting a more overarching viewpoint.} This might also be a good place to describe your positive and negative experiences related to the work you carried out.
\end{itemize} 
Occasionally these sections are intermingled, if this allows for a better presentation of your work. However, try to distinguish between measurements or hard data (results) and extrapolations, interpretations, or speculations (discussion).
\item[Conclusions] should summarize your findings and possible improvements or recommendations.
\item[Bibliography] is a must in a scientific report. {\LaTeX} and \texttt{bibtex} offer great support for  handling references and automatically generating bibliographies.
\item[Appendices] should contain lengthy details of the experimental setup, mathematical proofs, code download information, and shorter code snippets. Avoid longer code listings. Source code should rather be made available for download on a website or on-line repository of your choosing.
